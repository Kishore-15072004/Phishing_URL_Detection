# Phishing URL Detection

This project aims to detect phishing URLs using machine learning algorithms. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and a web application built using Streamlit to predict whether a given URL is likely to be a phishing attempt.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/phishing-url-detection.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd phishing-url-detection
    ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. **Load the dataset and preprocess it:**
    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv('dataset_phishing.csv')
    df.dropna(inplace=True)
    ```

2. **Train the model:**
    ```python
    python train_model.py
    ```

### Running the Web Application

1. **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Enter the URL to be checked for phishing and click the "Check URL" button.**

## Features

- **URL Analysis**: Extracts various features from the URL such as length, presence of special characters, and digits ratio.
- **Model Training**: Uses machine learning classifiers like KNN, MLP, and AdaBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of each model and selects the best one.
- **Web Application**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for checking URLs for phishing.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant features from the URL for model training.
2. **Standardization**: Standardizes the features to have zero mean and unit variance.

## Model Training

1. **Classifiers**: Uses KNN, MLP, and AdaBoost classifiers.
2. **Grid Search**: Performs grid search to find the best hyperparameters for each model.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluates the models based on test accuracy and selects the best model.

## Web Application

The web application is built using Streamlit and allows users to check if a URL is likely to be a phishing attempt.
